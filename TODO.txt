TODO
Version 1.01
* New save / load methods for using getSimSerialNumber
* Super detailed logging for CommandProcessor, to help finding bugs

Version 1.1
* Set up alarm for detecting SIM-change and deactivate it once the SIM PIN is unlocked
* Correct SMS sending functionality
* Write current state to enable more robust process in handling actions

* More verbose email message with gmaps embedded
* Better response-text: Location-method? Time of location
* Refactor replyhandling out of CommandProcessor
* Set to stolen-mode. Sends location every 10th minute


Mental notes

States:
* GOT LOCATION SMS / GOT STOLEN SMS
* DETECTED SIM CHANGE
* IDLE / STOLEN

* Need to make sure that the app handles all actions
* Whenever an action is received (Got SMS or Detected SIM), 
 state should be set and an alarm should be set up.
* On startup an alarm should be set up if not IDLE state
* The alarm can handle the state
* Or use the Handler functionality?

BOOT
* Check SIM
 - Locked => Set up alarm
 - Unlocked and changed => Write state, kick off handler
 - When handler finishes, save state and new SIM-Serial
 - If in PROCESS_SMS state, kick off CommandProcessor

ON SMS (CommandProcessor)
* Check secret message
 - On secret =>
  - Write state
  - Run handler to receive location
  - When handler finishes, run handler to send message
  - When handler finishes, write state



Find by GPS:
* Setup timeout-thread
* Request location updates
* Sleep(timeout)
  LocationUpdate:
    - call processLocation
    - All done!
  AbortGPS
    - Will post to main thread internalAbortGPS



SMSHandler starts LocationMessageService
 * LMS calls cmdProcessor
 * LMS starts new thread that waits for cmdProcessor (Sleep)
