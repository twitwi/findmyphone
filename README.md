- added a build script
- made sms format configurable (map url...)

## Description (from F-Droid)

If you lose your phone having this app installed can help you find it. Upon receipt of an SMS or email, FindMyPhone gets your location and communicates the location back to the owner. Note that GPS may need be enabled and the phone within view of the sky for an accurate location to be obtained. The app will fall back to using Google's network location API, but we recommend you disable that nonfree software anyway. Currently supports activating by sending a secret message via SMS or an email to K-9 Mail. The resulting location is sent via SMS.
